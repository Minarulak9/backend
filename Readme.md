# Backend Development Journey

This repository documents my journey learning backend development with Node.js, from fundamentals to advanced concepts. It contains practical, real-world examples that demonstrate the progression of skills and knowledge in building robust backend systems.

## üõ† Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript
- Familiarity with Git and command-line tools
- Understanding of REST APIs & Basic Computing knowledge

## üöÄ Learning Path

This project follows a step-by-step approach to mastering backend development:

1. **Fundamentals**: Setting up a basic Node.js server
2. **Express Framework**: Building APIs with Express.js
3. **Database Integration**: Working with MongoDB and Mongoose
4. **Authentication**: Implementing JWT-based auth system
5. **Advanced Patterns**: Middleware, error handling, and security best practices
6. **Performance Optimization**: Scaling and improving backend performance
7. **Fastify**: High-performance backend development with Fastify
8. **NestJS**: Developing modular and scalable applications with NestJS
9. **Microservices**: Building distributed systems with microservices architecture
10. **GraphQL**: Implementing GraphQL APIs for efficient data fetching
11. **CI/CD & DevOps**: Automating deployments and managing infrastructure


## üìã What You'll Find Here

- Practical code examples that build upon each other
- Detailed comments explaining concepts and implementation decisions
- Real-world scenarios and solutions
- Progressive complexity as concepts advance

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side development
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building APIs
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for data storage
- **Mongoose**: ODM for MongoDB
- **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens for authentication
- **bcrypt**: Password hashing library
- **dotenv**: Environment variable management

## üß™ Testing with Postman
Postman is an essential tool for API development and testing. Use it to interact with the endpoints created in this project.

### üöÄ Getting Started with Postman
#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Download Postman
- Download and install Postman from the official website: [Postman Download](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).
- Follow the installation instructions based on your OS.
- Open Postman and sign in (optional but recommended for saving requests).

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a New Request
- Click on **New** ‚Üí **Request**.
- Select the HTTP method (e.g., **GET, POST, PUT, DELETE**).
- Enter the API endpoint URL in the request field.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Add Request Headers
- Click on the **Headers** tab.
- Add necessary headers like:
  ```
  Content-Type: application/json
  Authorization: Bearer <your-token>
  ```

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Add Query Parameters (Optional)
- Click on the **Params** tab.
- Enter key-value pairs for query parameters if required (e.g., `?id=123`).

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Add Body Data (For POST, PUT, PATCH Requests)
- Click on the **Body** tab.
- Select **raw** and choose `JSON`.
- Enter JSON data, for example:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "johndoe@example.com"
  }
  ```

#### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Send the Request
- Click the **Send** button.
- View the response status code and data in the **Response** section.

#### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Save and Organize Requests
- Click **Save** to store the request for future use.
- Create **Collections** to organize multiple requests.

#### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Automate Testing with Tests
- Click on the **Tests** tab and add JavaScript-based tests:
  ```js
  pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
      pm.response.to.have.status(200);
  });
  ```

#### 9Ô∏è‚É£ Use Environments & Variables
- Click on **Environments** ‚Üí **New Environment**.
- Define variables like `{{base_url}}`, then use them in requests.
- Example: `{{base_url}}/api/users`.

#### üîü View API Logs & Debug
- Check **Console** (View ‚Üí Show Postman Console) for debugging.
- Inspect request/response details to fix errors.

### üéØ Conclusion
By following these steps, you can efficiently test APIs using Postman, debug issues, and automate test cases.
