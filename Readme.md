# Backend Development Journey

This repository documents my journey learning backend development with Node.js, from fundamentals to advanced concepts. It contains practical, real-world examples that demonstrate the progression of skills and knowledge in building robust backend systems.

## üöÄ Learning Path

This project follows a step-by-step approach to mastering backend development:

1. **Fundamentals**: Setting up a basic Node.js server
2. **Express Framework**: Building APIs with Express.js
3. **Database Integration**: Working with MongoDB and Mongoose
4. **Authentication**: Implementing JWT-based auth system
5. **Advanced Patterns**: Middleware, error handling, and security best practices
6. **Performance Optimization**: Scaling and improving backend performance

## üìã What You'll Find Here

- Practical code examples that build upon each other
- Detailed comments explaining concepts and implementation decisions
- Real-world scenarios and solutions
- Progressive complexity as concepts advance

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side development
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building APIs
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for data storage
- **Mongoose**: ODM for MongoDB
- **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens for authentication
- **bcrypt**: Password hashing library
- **dotenv**: Environment variable management
