# Backend Development Journey

This repository documents my journey learning backend development with Node.js, from fundamentals to advanced concepts. It contains practical, real-world examples that demonstrate the progression of skills and knowledge in building robust backend systems.

## 🚀 Learning Path

This project follows a step-by-step approach to mastering backend development:

1. **Fundamentals**: Setting up a basic Node.js server
2. **Express Framework**: Building APIs with Express.js
3. **Database Integration**: Working with MongoDB and Mongoose
4. **Authentication**: Implementing JWT-based auth system
5. **Advanced Patterns**: Middleware, error handling, and security best practices
6. **Performance Optimization**: Scaling and improving backend performance

## 📋 What You'll Find Here

- Practical code examples that build upon each other
- Detailed comments explaining concepts and implementation decisions
- Real-world scenarios and solutions
- Progressive complexity as concepts advance

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side development
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building APIs
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for data storage
- **Mongoose**: ODM for MongoDB
- **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens for authentication
- **bcrypt**: Password hashing library
- **dotenv**: Environment variable management

## 🚦 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Minarulak9/backend.git
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file with:
   ```
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your_database
   JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
   ```

4. **Run the server**
   ```
   # Development mode with nodemon
   npm run dev
   
   # Production mode
   npm start
   ```

## 📝 Current Implementations

### User Authentication System

- User registration with password encryption
- Login with JWT token generation
- Protected routes using auth middleware
- User data retrieval

### API Endpoints

#### Authentication
- `POST /api/users/register` - Register a new user
- `POST /api/users/login` - Authenticate and receive token
- `GET /api/users/me` - Get current user (protected)

## 🔜 Coming Next

- Role-based access control
- Password reset functionality
- OAuth integration
- File uploads
- Pagination and filtering
- API documentation with Swagger
- Unit and integration testing
- WebSockets for real-time features
